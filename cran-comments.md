Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:

  The Title field should be in title case. Current version is:
  'Create 'hexSticker' for R package with 'shiny''
  In title case that is:
  'Create 'hexSticker' for R Package with 'shiny''

## Review Commments

Thanks, I'm not sure if this title is very helpful...
What do you mean with "for R Package"?
Maybe just:
Create Hex Stickers with 'shiny'

Please replace \dontrun{} by if(interactive()){} in your Rd-file.

Please fix and resubmit.

Best,
